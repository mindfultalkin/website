              Our client has a mature SaaS product in the production planning software for manufacturing companies. The application incorporates the dynamics of the 3Ms - manpower, machine and material to produce a plan and schedule that can be used on the factory floor for production. When their engineering team provided just-in-time help documents to go along with their feature release, their European customers rejected them. The need for cohesive and accurate documentation became increasingly critical for client deployments, as well as for internal teams.

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              During the initial phase when we were getting comfortable with the product and domain, we came across a few complexities that we had to adopt, adapt and navigate to deliver value.
            </p>
            <ul className="list-inside space-y-2 text-muted-foreground">
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Product Expertise with a few employees:</strong> The application knowledge resided with a few SMEs and long-time employees, creating a bottleneck.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Limited or No Documentation:</strong> There was limited content to update or improve upon. The content available was mostly recordings of zoom meetings where a few team leads or SMEs have explained to new employees.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Complex and Multiple Features:</strong> The application was used within factory environments with multiple configurations and operational dependencies. This meant multiple features were available, each with various configurations.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-primary">High Support Load:</strong> Frequent queries on setup and usage resulted in high support ticket volume.</li>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              To build accurate, helpful documentation from scratch, we followed a structured, hands-on discovery and development process:
            </p>
            <ol className="list-inside space-y-3 text-muted-foreground">
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Stakeholder Interviews:</strong> We interacted with SMEs and interviewed them to extract functional and contextual knowledge about the application.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Application Immersion:</strong> Our team actively explored and interacted with the application to understand its capabilities, user journey, and potential friction points.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Use Case Mapping:</strong> We identified where and how the application was used, focusing on real-world industrial scenarios.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Factory Digital Twin:</strong> To give context to the documentation, we created a digital twin of a factory environment where the application was typically deployed. This served as a running example throughout the documentation, helping readers visualize context, workflows, and decisions.</li>
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Audience Analysis:</strong> We identified primary users of the documentation:
                <ul className="list-disc ml-6 space-y-1">
                  <li>Implementation engineers at the customer location, needed installation and configuration guidance</li>
                  <li>Internal teams for onboarding and knowledge transfer</li>
                  <li>Support teams for troubleshooting</li>

              </li>
              <li><strong className="text-primary">Interim Deliverables leading to CI/CD integration:</strong> We prioritized and delivered focused documents for features with a high ticket count. After 12 months of engagement, the documentation is aligned with the CI/CD pipeline and in sync with the releases.</li>

            <p className="text-muted-foreground leading-relaxed">
              The team interacted with the subject matter experts (SMEs) within the organization, asked them questions, watched previous knowledge sharing videos, explored the application in different use cases, and conducted research about products in a similar space. As a result, we developed accurate, concise and visually appealing:

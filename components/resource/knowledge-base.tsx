                        Our client is a fast-scaling mediatech SaaS company. The product owner had a clear vision that the product documentation must empower users to become self-reliant in using the product through an intuitive, well-structured documentation. The product was complex and feature-rich, requiring users to understand fundamental media-tech concepts before onboarding. Our mission was to build their documentation suite from the ground up and the educational content that equipped users to use the product effectively.

                            <li><strong>Deep Immersion into Media Tech:</strong> We began by reading basic concepts on the internet, watched internal product explainer videos. This allowed us to get the underlying concepts of the product right.</li>
                            <li><strong>Reviews with SMEs:</strong> We documented our understanding of the concept, created visuals that could be used in the documents and later on in explainer videos. This was confirmed by the SMEs before continuing with further work and how-tos with the software.</li>
                            <li><strong>Sprint-Aligned Updates:</strong> At the end of each sprint, we presented updated documents reflecting the latest feature set. This agile-aligned documentation process ensured the features and documentation was always in-sync.</li>
                            <li><strong>Use-Case Driven Examples:</strong> To help users visualize application in real scenarios, we included sample use cases and walk-throughs. These ranged from basic onboarding flows to advanced configurations, increasing users' confidence in the product. We were also aware of copyright infringement that could result if we used the wrong examples or media samples in the screenshots, and were meticulous in checking to avoid them.</li>
                            <li><strong>Repurposing for Learning:</strong> The documented use cases were later transformed into audio scripts, forming the backbone of a certification course for end-users.</li>
